# Simple Web Site
The original page from this project was designed to practice responsive page design. In this iteration, it has been edited to work with 11ty and sass. This is the user's first time dipping their toes into 11ty and sass.

The poem featured on this page, Nothing Gold Can Stay, was published by Robert Frost in 1923.
